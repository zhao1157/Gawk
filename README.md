# Gawk
## ========== 1. Learning_Gawk/{learning_awk.sh & refresh_awk.sh}
### My learning philosophy: 
1. Practice the syntax of the new language and test my understanding of it by putting it into various situations; 
2. Integrate what I have leant with the new piece I'm learning to improve my understanding and view of the new language; 
3. Compare with other languages I have learnt and try to solve some similar problems encountered before with the new language.

### My goals: 
1. Be familiar with and  master the new language; 
2. Through writing codes and testing of them, take good notes of the new language; 
3. Form my own syntax library of the new language for future review.
